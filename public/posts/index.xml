      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Iris, full-time networking-developer-devopsec-whatever engineer, part-time writer, and cat enthusiast. I decided to remake my personal webpage I made a few months on hugo, due to incredibly quick rendering speed and the ease of deployment.&#xA;My Approach Hugo seemed like the next best approached to my Resume/Blog/Project/REDACTE website when I was initally considering redesigning everything. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess around with raw html and css, I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a frontend designer, but I am forcing myself to interact more with frontend elements.</description>
